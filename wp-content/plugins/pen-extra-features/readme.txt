== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the Pro version of the theme? =

There is no "Pro" version for the [Pen theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/pen "Pen - Multi-purpose WordPress Theme").
The free version has all the features and you are allowed to use it for your personal and commercial projects.
Nevertheless, if you need more support than what is provided here (e.g. over a weekend, extensive customization, etc), or if you are getting really rich by using this theme :), or if you would like to just support the development, then you are more than welcome to click one of those Buy Now buttons on [our website](https://www.htmlpie.com/), and thank you for that in advance, we truly appreciate it.

= How can I apply the modifications e.g. color scheme(s) from another site that I've built using the Pen theme to a new one? =

* First you should make sure that you have installed this plugin on both sites.
* Login to the WP back-end of the finished website and then go to 'Pen Theme' -> 'Customization Export', copy or download that huge code.
* Login to the new site and go to 'Pen Theme' -> 'Customization Import', now paste the whole code there and carefully check the preview before clicking the Import button, make ensure everything is exactly as you want because there's no way to revert this.
* Finally click the Import button and check your front-end to ensure everything is just as you were expected.

= Should I use the Pen theme itself or use a Child theme? =

If you need to extensively customize this theme which would include editing theme files too, then you would indeed need a Child theme.
Here are the top reasons [why you should use Child themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/#what-is-a-child-theme).
Otherwise, just use the Pen theme itself.

= I do need a Child theme, how can I create one? =

There are a number of plugins which would let you create a Child theme with just a few clicks.
You can go to your Plugins page and search for "child theme creator", you will find several plugins to install and use.

= How can I help? =

Glad you asked that! :)
You can help in a number of ways:
* Suggest us new features, or just tell us what do you think, e.g. what would you like to change and such.
* Promote the theme on social media, recommend it to your friends, etc.
* Test the theme against as many plugins and browsers as you can and tell us if there were any issues.
* [Rate the theme](https://wordpress.org/support/theme/pen/reviews/) and [the plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pen-extra-features/reviews/), hopefully five stars. :)
* Help [translate the theme](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/pen) and [the plugin](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/pen-extra-features).
Thank you! :)

== Screenshots ==

1. With the Pen theme you can customize almost every aspect of the theme for each and every post, page, or WC product.
2. Using the plugin you can also import your content-level customization from one content to another with only a few clicks. You can also name them so you can easily remember which content had what kind of customization, for example "No sidebar", "Jumping featured image", "No site header\footer", etc. With these two features you would no longer need the traditional "Page Templates" to create custom layouts; you can instantly create whatever layout that you want and then use them on other posts or products.
3. You can export the modifications made through the "Pen" sections of the Customizer and then import them to any other site that uses the Pen theme.
4. We all know how hard it is to navigate through the Customizer, often confusing, especially with a theme like Pen that offers over 400 customization options. The toolbar menu of the Pen plugin provides easier access to various parts of the Customizer, drastically improving the user experience and speeding up site building.
5. The Pen theme itself comes with all these tiny little shortcut menus with little pen icons that are scattered all over your site, these menus also make it easier to access different parts of the Customizer.
6. You can have a blue color scheme for your entire site but a purple one for a particular post, page, or WooCommerce product; same also applies to typography options.
7. You can have widgets with different color schemes with just a few clicks.
8. Several very beautiful color schemes included.
